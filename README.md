# Reduced-and-Improved-Visibility-Graph-for-Robot-Path-Planning
Objectives: The objective of the project is to 1- get familiar with Visibility Graph (VG) technique-based robot global path planning. 2- apply the Visibility Graph technique of robot global path planning in workspace with a variety of obstacles. 3- improve this Visibility Graph technique of robot path planning and attempt creation of Reduced Visibility Graph (RVG) algorithm. 4- revise the Visibility Graph learned in the classroom to Tangent Graph-based (TG) path planning (optional).
